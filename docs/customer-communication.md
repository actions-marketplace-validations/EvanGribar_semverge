# Customer communication model

SemVerge keeps release classification and customer communication as separate concerns. The release engine still decides the release kind, breaking status, version, readiness, and publication behavior deterministically. A parsed change also carries a structured `customerCommunication` value for customer-facing renderers.

## Model

```ts
type CustomerImpact = "new" | "improved" | "fixed" | "changed";

type CustomerCommunication = {
  headline?: string;
  outcome: string;
  detail?: string;
  impact: CustomerImpact;
  actionRequired?: string;
  audience?: string[];
};
```

`outcome` is the customer-readable result of the change. `detail` adds useful context without changing the release classification. `actionRequired` records a concrete customer action when one exists. `audience` is an optional list of intended audiences such as `users`, `admins`, or `developers`.

## Pull-request metadata

The low-friction `customer:` field remains supported. Richer communication can be authored in the same hidden metadata block:

```md
<!-- semverge
type: feature
headline: Bulk project exports
outcome: Teams can download multiple projects in one step.
detail: Exported data keeps the same format as individual project exports.
impact: new
action: No action is required.
audience: [teams, admins]
-->
```

For JSON metadata, use the same field names:

```json
{
  "type": "breaking",
  "outcome": "API responses use the normalized data shape.",
  "impact": "changed",
  "action": "Update clients to read data.items."
}
```

The precedence is deterministic:

1. `outcome` is used when present.
2. Legacy `customer` is used when `outcome` is absent.
3. The conventional-commit description is used as a conservative fallback.

The `impact` field follows the authored value when present. Otherwise SemVerge derives `new` for features, `fixed` for fixes, `changed` for breaking changes, and `improved` for other kinds. The inferred value describes communication tone; it never changes the authoritative release kind or bump.

Missing richer fields do not require AI and do not block a release. Renderers should read `customerCommunication` (or its compatibility alias `customerSummary`) instead of reading raw commit or pull-request descriptions for normal customer output. Internal and documentation changes remain available to technical artifacts but are not automatically customer-facing.

## Customer notes

The deterministic customer-note renderer presents outcomes in audience language: `New`, `Improved`, `Fixed`, and `Changed`. It does not lead with release counts, semver bump terminology, commit subjects, or pull-request numbers. A changed/breaking outcome includes an explicit upgrade warning and an `Action required` section sourced from authored action or migration metadata; if no action was supplied, it asks the reader to review the changed behavior. Action sections are omitted for ordinary no-action releases. The technical changelog keeps its separate category and traceability format.

## Quality gates

Customer notes and announcements can be linted independently with a focused technical-language check:

```yaml
communication:
  customerQuality:
    mode: warn # off | warn | error
    allowTerms: [API, registry]
```

`warn` (the default) reports findings in the release PR without blocking publication. `error` makes a finding fail readiness and prevents the publication transaction from proceeding; `off` skips the checks. Findings identify the rule, line, and matching excerpt. `allowTerms` suppresses only findings on lines containing the configured product-specific term, so other rules remain active. The check is not applied to the developer changelog or internal summary.

## External announcements

Announcements use a separate `AnnouncementView` rather than copying the changelog or customer-note sections. The deterministic fallback contains a headline, one outcome-focused summary, a short `Highlights` list, an `Action required` section when the release needs intervention, and an availability statement. Explicit `announcement:` metadata remains authoritative and is rendered verbatim after the stable SemVerge announcement heading. Internal-only releases receive a neutral no-update message instead of promotional copy.

## Golden fixtures and AI drafts

The audience boundary is protected by checked-in golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures/customer-communication/`. They cover capability releases, improvements, bug fixes, breaking migrations, partial breaking releases, technical API language, internal/documentation-only changes, prereleases, monorepo package details, and sparse conventional commits. The fixture test compares customer notes, external announcements, and the technical changelog independently so a useful technical term can remain in technical output without leaking internal implementation detail into customer output.

AI-enhanced customer notes are a separate review draft in the release PR. They use the same customer-facing change IDs and deterministic migration facts, while `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and the announcement artifact remain deterministic. A rejected or unavailable draft must leave the deterministic artifact unchanged.
